# Drive Processing Library

This library is responsible for retrieving,
processing and deleting data from cloud storage providers such as Google Drive and One Drive.

This library isn't intended to be run as a docker container or as a standalone service,
it is intended to be used as a dependency in other services primarily the ```authorisation-service```.

After a successful maven clean install,
the test coverage can be found and executed in the ```target/site/jacoco/index.html``` file.
